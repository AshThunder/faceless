Standing against the ethereal sage green of the hidden realm, their Stellar Sentinel mask holds echoes of the universe—a fragment of a forgotten story etched into the hidden realm. With their Abyssal Flight wings, they possess keys to unseen realms, granting a fleeting glimpse of truths that mortals cannot comprehend. The Faceless Tribe is always watching, appearing where destiny calls.",
